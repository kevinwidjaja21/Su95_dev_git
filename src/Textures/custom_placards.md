to use a custom placard with an airline registration. Copy the files of the airline folder into "flybywire-aircraft-a320-neo\SimObjects\AirPlanes\FlyByWire_A320_NEO\TEXTURE"
you can also add the files to a livery, you will have to edit the layout.json of the livery though. And add all the files you added.
